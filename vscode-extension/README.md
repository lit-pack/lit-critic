# lit-critic — VS Code Extension

An AI editorial assistant for novel writers, running directly inside VS Code.

The extension integrates with the lit-critic review system: it shows findings as squiggly underlines in your scene files, presents them in a sidebar tree, and opens a discussion panel where you can accept, reject, or debate each one — all without leaving your editor.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** with lit-critic installed:
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/lit-critic
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **An API key** for your chosen AI provider:
  - Anthropic: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  - OpenAI: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- A novel project folder containing `CANON.md`, `STYLE.md`, and scene files

---

## Installation

### VSIX package (regular use)

```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm install
npm run package
code --install-extension lit-critic-*.vsix --force
```

### Development (F5 launch)

```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm install
npm run compile
```

Open `vscode-extension/` in VS Code and press **F5**.

---

## Usage

### 1. Open your project

Open the folder that contains `CANON.md`. The extension activates automatically when `CANON.md` is detected.

> **If your novel project is outside the lit-critic installation folder**, set `litCritic.repoPath` in VS Code Settings to the full path of the lit-critic directory (the one containing `lit-critic-server.py`).

### 2. Run analysis

Press **`Ctrl+Shift+L`** or run `lit-critic: Analyze` from the Command Palette.

Select one or more consecutive scenes in the scene selector. The extension starts the local server automatically and runs all seven lenses in parallel (~30–90 seconds).

### 3. Review findings

Findings appear as squiggly underlines (red = critical, yellow = major, blue = minor) and in the **Findings** sidebar. The **Discussion Panel** opens with the first finding.

For each finding:
- **Accept** — agree, mark resolved
- **Reject** — disagree, optionally provide a reason
- **Discuss** — type a message; the AI responds and may revise or withdraw
- **Skip** — move on without deciding

### 4. Save and resume

Progress is saved automatically after every action. To resume a session: press `Ctrl+Shift+L` — the tool offers to pick up where you left off. If you've moved your project folder, it will prompt for the new path.

### 5. Refresh knowledge

After writing or revising scenes, click **Refresh Knowledge** in the Knowledge view toolbar to extract updated characters, terms, threads, and timeline entries from your prose.
